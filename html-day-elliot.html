        Elliot mainly plays guitar but has become an excellent asset to the band with his hard hitting drums and powerful
        fills to keep the audience engaged. Now when he sees anything that he can add to his drum kit to hit,
        you better believe that it'll be on there quicker than Greg can send out a band practice PDF document, which is pretty fast.
